# Description of the Game: Blackjack

In the well-known card game of blackjack, the goal is to get as near to a hand value of 21 as you can without going over. Between the player and the dealer, the game is played. After receiving their initial two cards, each player has the option to "hit" to draw more cards or "stand" to maintain their existing hand. Face cards are worth 10, whereas aces have a value of either 1 or 11. All other cards are worth their respective face values. The dealer must adhere to a certain set of guidelines while choosing to hit or stand. When a player's hand totals more than 21, they instantly lose. If a player's hand totals more than the dealer's and is closer to 21, they win. When a player busts or the dealer's hand is close to 21, the dealer wins.

## User Experience: Getting Started
1.	Start of the game: 
a.	After the players place their bet, the dealer deals two cards to the players and two cards to themselves (the dealer creates hands:  two cards each)
b.	The players have both of their cards exposed, and the dealer only has one card exposed as the second is dealt face down.

2.	Payer’s Turn:
a.	The players decide if they want to “hit” and receive another card and make sure they should not exceed 21 points or “stand” and keep their current hand (stop taking more cards).
b.	If the players’ hand exceeds 21 points, they “bust” and lose the game.

3.	Dealer’s Turn:
a.	It is the dealer’s turn to play if the players stand without busting.
b.	The dealer will reveal the face-down card and must continue to hit until their hand exceeds 16 points, or they bust.

4.	Winning or Losing:
a.	Both players should not exceed 21 points, if they do so, they bust and loses the bet.
b.	If the player’s hand is higher than the dealer’s without busting (so less than 22), the player wins (and can receive a payout equal to their original bet)
c.	If the dealer’s hand is higher than the player’s without busting, the player loses their bet.
d.	If the hands are tied, it is a “push”. The player receives their bet back.
