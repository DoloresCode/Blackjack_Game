# Description of the Game: Blackjack

In the well-known card game of blackjack, the goal is to get as near to a hand value of 21 as you can without going over. Between the player and the dealer, the game is played. After receiving their initial two cards, each player has the option to "hit" to draw more cards or "stand" to maintain their existing hand. Face cards are worth 10, whereas aces have a value of either 1 or 11. All other cards are worth their respective face values. The dealer must adhere to a certain set of guidelines while choosing to hit or stand. When a player's hand totals more than 21, they instantly lose. If a player's hand totals more than the dealer's and is closer to 21, they win. When a player busts or the dealer's hand is close to 21, the dealer wins.
